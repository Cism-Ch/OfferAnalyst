## 🎯 Key Objectives

### Problem: Siloed States
- Each page manages localStorage independently
- Data diverges during navigation
- Impossible to synchronize across pages

**Solution**: Centralized MongoDB + React Query

### Problem: Data Consistency
- Compare page shows stale offers
- Projects reference deleted searches
- History restore broken

**Solution**: Server-driven state + Event-driven sync

### Problem: Limited Scale
- localStorage maxes at 50 items
- No real-time search
- Single browser only

**Solution**: Cloud database + Full-text indexing

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Data Consistency** | 0% | 100% |
| **Cross-page Sync** | Manual | Automatic |
| **History Limit** | 50 items | Unlimited |
| **Search Latency** | N/A | < 200ms |
| **API Uptime** | N/A | 99.9% |
| **Test Coverage** | ~30% | >80% |
