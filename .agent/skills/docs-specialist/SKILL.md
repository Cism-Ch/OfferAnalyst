# Documentation Specialist

This skill focuses on maintaining a high-quality, organized, and consistent documentation ecosystem for the project.

## Responsibilities

### 1. Technical Writing
- **Clarity and Precision**: Write clear, jargon-free documentation.
- **Consistency**: Ensure terminology matches the implementation in the codebase.
- **Premium Aesthetics**: Use GitHub-style alerts (`NOTE`, `TIP`, `IMPORTANT`, `WARNING`, `CAUTION`) and Mermaid diagrams for clarity.

### 2. Organization (`docs/` folder)
- **Centralized Docs**: All technical specifications, architecture diagrams, and meeting notes belong in the root `docs/` directory.
- **Indexing**: Maintain a clear `docs/README.md` or `docs/INDEX.md` mapping the contents.
- **Artifact Sync**: Ensure `task.md` and `walkthrough.md` reflect the actual progress and finalized state of a feature.

### 3. Maintenance and Auditing
- **Updating**: Never implement a feature without updating the relevant technical documentation.
- **Cleaning**: Periodically review and archive obsolete documents or notes.
- **Readability**: Ensure long documents use a Table of Contents and logical heading hierarchy.

## Standards
- **File Format**: Use Markdown (`.md`) exclusively for technical text.
- **Linking**: Use descriptive, relative links to other documents or specific files in the repository.
- **Architecture**: Document major design decisions (ADRs) and infrastructure changes.
